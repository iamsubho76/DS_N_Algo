 * Kâ€™th smallest element in an unsorted array using Binary Search on Answer:
 * To find the kth smallest element using binary search on the answer, we start
 * by defining a search range based on the minimum and maximum values in the
 * input array. In each iteration of binary search, we count the elements
 * smaller than or equal to the midpoint and update the search range
 * accordingly. This process continues until the range collapses to a single
 * element, which is the kth smallest element.
 * 
 * Follow the given steps to solve the problem:
 * 
 * Intialize low and high to minimum and maximum element of the array denoting
 * the range within which the answer lies.
 * Apply Binary Search on this range.
 * If the selected element by calculating mid has less than K elements lesser to
 * it then increase the number that is low = mid + 1.
 * Otherwise, Decrement the high pointer, i.e high = m
